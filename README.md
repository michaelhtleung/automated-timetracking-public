# Todo:

## features to add:
1. can pull data from a specified date, maybe using command line arguments (eg. python3 fetcher_logger 05 17 2020)
1. can pull data from a specified range of dates, maybe using command line arguments (eg. python3 fetcher_logger 05 12 2020 05 17 2020)
1. can pull data from a multiple specified dates not necessarily in a range maybe using command line arguments (eg. python3 fetcher_logger 05 12 2020 05 14 2020 05 16 2020 ). the challenge becomes "how do I parse a range of dates vs multiple dates?". I think the answer is to use flags in the CLI.

## data science
1. use python to visualize your data
1. use python to answer your questions about your behaviour
1. make a bullet point list of key takeaways from your data analytics
1. make a simple web dashboard that runs on a local webserver (eg. flask) to visualize data
